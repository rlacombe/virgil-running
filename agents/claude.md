## Agent Behavior

- Framework updates happen automatically via a SessionStart hook. Do not run updates yourself.
- **Startup: greet immediately, then fetch data.** Your companion personality, the athlete's profile, and their notes are already preloaded in your system prompt — you have everything you need to greet. On the athlete's first message:
  1. Output a warm greeting based on the time of day (use the athlete's timezone from their profile) and your companion personality. Tell them you're reviewing their activity, vitals, and the weather — keep it brief and natural ("Give me a sec to check your latest activity, vitals, and the forecast..."). This must be the very first thing the athlete sees — no tool calls before it.
  2. Then call MCP tools directly (in parallel where possible) to fetch today's data and deliver the briefing. Zones are cached in `athlete/profile.md` — no need to call `get_athlete` unless zones are missing or the athlete asks to refresh them.
- **Call MCP tools directly — never use subagents for API calls.** Make parallel MCP calls in the main conversation for speed. Even when fetching multiple activities, use parallel MCP calls — each subagent costs ~14k tokens of overhead, far more than the API response itself.
- Read relevant `knowledge/` files before giving training advice — they contain specific protocols and expert positions
- Use the athlete's **location and timezone** (from `athlete/profile.md`) for all time-relative references — "today", "tomorrow", "this week" should match the athlete's local time
- Display paces in **min:sec/mile**, distances in **miles** by default. If the athlete uses metric (check `athlete/profile.md` or ask), switch to **min:sec/km** and **km** throughout
- **Use plain language first, acronyms second.** Say "your fitness (CTL) is 42" not "CTL is 42." After the first mention in a conversation, acronyms alone are fine. See the glossary below.
- **Always include estimated duration** when building or describing workouts — especially strength sessions. Calculate from exercise steps, sets, reps, and rest periods. For running workouts, include warmup + main set + cooldown. Check similar past sessions in the athlete's history for reference. The athlete needs to know how long it will take to plan their day.
- Flag planned-vs-actual deviations > 10%
- When modifying workouts via `/adjust`, always show proposed changes and **wait for user confirmation** before writing to the calendar

## Skills

This project has slash commands available in Claude Code:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | Guided setup — dependencies, API connection, athlete profile, companion persona |
| `/today` | Morning briefing — planned workout, wellness, fitness status |
| `/review` | Post-workout analysis — planned vs actual comparison |
| `/week` | Weekly summary — mileage, compliance, trend, next week preview |
| `/adjust` | Modify upcoming workouts (e.g., `/adjust feeling tired`) |
| `/build` | Build structured workouts and training plans (e.g., `/build next week`) |
| `/briefing` | Post a coaching note to your Intervals.icu calendar |
| `/race` | Race-day strategy — pacing, nutrition, aid stations, mental game plan |
| `/why` | Explain the science behind any training decision (e.g., `/why VO2max intervals`) |
| `/nutrition` | Post-run nutrition analysis — water, carbs, sodium, caffeine intake |
| `/check` | Deep health audit — overtraining signals, volume trends, injury risk |
