# Virgil

**Your ultrarunning training companion.** Named after Dante's guide through the underworld — a calm, knowledgeable companion who walks beside you through the hardest passages, explains what you're seeing, and lets you make the decisions. If you've ever been at mile 80 of a 100-miler at 3am, you know that's not a metaphor.

Virgil connects to your [Intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) account — your training calendar, wellness data, and fitness trends — and uses [established exercise science](#recommended-reading) to help you make the most of your training and prepare for your next trail race. Built on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Virgil works through natural conversation: reviewing workouts, adjusting plans, flagging risks, and answering questions about your training.

## Why This Exists

The best coaches and athletes in ultrarunning have spent lifetimes learning what works — on hundred-mile courses, at altitude, through seasons of trial and injury and quiet persistence. Books like [Training for the Uphill Athlete](#recommended-reading), [Training Essentials for Ultrarunners](#recommended-reading), and [Science of Running](#recommended-reading) have distilled that wisdom into frameworks any runner can learn from.

But most recreational athletes don't have access to a coach — or, if they do, their time is sparse and focused on high-level goals and critical advice, rather than the minutiae of a changing schedule.

This project aims to bridge that gap: a tool that reads your training data, applies established coaching frameworks, and talks you through what to do on a Tuesday morning when your HRV is down and your schedule just changed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is not a replacement for a human coach.** A good coach brings experience, intuition, and a relationship that no tool can replicate. If you can work with one, you should — see [Working with a Coach](#working-with-a-coach) below.

This tool can complement that relationship by handling the day-to-day details between sessions. For the many runners who train alone, it offers something better than a static plan: science-based guidance that adapts to how your training is actually going.

We encourage you to [buy the books](#recommended-reading). They're excellent, they'll make you a better and more self-aware athlete, and they support the authors whose work makes this project possible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **[Intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu)** account connected to your sports watch (Garmin, Suunto, COROS, Apple Watch, etc.). Intervals.icu is free and syncs your training data automatically.
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — a command-line interface for Claude. You'll need an Anthropic account with a Claude Pro or Max subscription.

### Install Claude Code

If you don't have Claude Code yet:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This gives you the `claude` command. On first run, it will walk you through signing in to your Anthropic account. See the [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for details.

### Set up Virgil

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlacombe/virgil-running.git
cd virgil-running
claude
```

That's it — you're now talking to Virgil. Type `/setup` and it will walk you through connecting your Intervals.icu account and building your athlete profile.

### How it works

Virgil is not a traditional app — there's no UI to install, no server to run. The repository contains a coaching framework (`CLAUDE.md`), a knowledge base (`knowledge/`), and a set of skills (`.claude/skills/`) that turn Claude Code into a specialized training companion. When you run `claude` inside this directory, it loads the framework automatically and becomes Virgil.

Your personal data is stored in `ATHLETE.md` (gitignored) and stays local — it won't be shared or overwritten when you pull updates.

## What You Can Do

### Morning check-in

```
> What's on tap for today?

Today's workout: Easy run — 6 mi, Zone 2
Wellness: Sleep 7.2h, HRV 48 (below your 52 avg), resting HR 54
Form: TSB -4 (neutral) — CTL 42, ATL 46

You're slightly fatigued with below-average HRV. Good day for your easy run,
but keep it genuinely easy. If you feel flat in the first mile, no shame in
cutting to 5.
```

### After a workout

```
> How did my tempo go?

Planned: 8 mi with 3x10min at threshold
Actual: 8.3 mi, 1:05:12, avg HR 158

Your tempo intervals averaged 7:42/mi at 165 bpm — right in your threshold
zone. Solid execution. The 0.3 mi overshoot is fine. Recovery between
intervals was clean — HR dropped to 138 within 90 seconds each time.

One flag: your pace drifted from 7:35 to 7:52 across the three intervals.
That's normal fatigue, but watch for a pattern — if drift worsens next week,
we may need to shorten the intervals or add recovery.
```

### Weekly summary

```
> /week

This week: 38.2 mi / 3,400 ft vert (planned 40 mi)
Compliance: 95% — you skipped Thursday's strides, everything else on target
Fitness trend: CTL 42 → 43 (building), TSB recovering toward race week

Next week is your last big week before taper. Saturday's long run (18 mi,
4,200 ft) is the key session. Prioritize sleep and easy effort through
Wednesday to arrive fresh.
```

### Adjusting the plan

```
> I have a work trip Tuesday through Thursday — can't run those days.

Looking at your week. You have a tempo Tuesday, easy Wednesday, and
hill repeats Thursday. Here's what I'd do:

- Move the tempo to Monday (swap with your scheduled easy day)
- Tuesday–Thursday: rest. Travel fatigue is real, don't fight it.
- Keep Friday's easy run as a shakeout
- Saturday long run stays — you'll be fresh for it

### Understanding your training

```
> /why am I doing VO2max intervals before building my base?

Two coaches approach this differently:

Scott Johnston says base first — build your aerobic engine for months
before adding intensity. His logic: "There is no shortcut to building
the aerobic base." Most amateurs have aerobic deficiency syndrome and
need Z2 volume before anything else.

Jason Koop says VO2max first — it's the least specific workout for
ultras, so it goes furthest from race day. His logic: raising the
ceiling lifts everything below it. "Targeting VO2max has a greater
lifting effect on lactate-threshold fitness than training at aerobic
intensities has on lifting VO2max."

Your AeT/AnT spread is 12% — that suggests your aerobic base could
use work. Johnston's approach may be the better fit right now. Once
that spread drops below 10%, intensity becomes more productive.
```

### Race-day planning

```
> /race

Race: Canyons 100K — April 26, 2025
Fitness: CTL 48, TSB trending to +6 by race day (fresh)

Pacing: 14:30-15:00 overall, 18:00/mi climbs, 10:30/mi descents
Nutrition: 260 cal/hr, 60g carbs/hr, 600mg sodium/L
Mental: Associate on climbs and technical. Dissociate on fire roads.
ADAPT framework if things go sideways.

```

### Just ask

You're not limited to slash commands. Ask anything:

- *"Am I ready for a 50K in October?"*
- *"Should I run or cross-train tomorrow?"*
- *"What's my vert progression been like this month?"*
- *"Is my HRV trend concerning?"*
- *"What does Scott Johnston think about weighted hiking?"*

## Skills

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

## Training Philosophy

Three principles guide every recommendation:

1. **Health before performance.** Long-term health always comes first. Overtraining, under-recovery, and injury risk get flagged — even if it means recommending DNS.
2. **Push hard when ready.** Within the bounds of health, the companion is direct and demanding. Easy days easy, hard days hard.
3. **Evidence over tradition.** Recommendations cite physiology and established frameworks. When experts disagree, both approaches are presented with reasoning — you choose.

### Knowledge Base

The `knowledge/` directory contains 16 reference docs covering training science topics — from aerobic base and periodization to race execution and injury prevention. Each doc synthesizes positions from Johnston, Koop, and Magness with specific protocols, quotes, and decision frameworks. These are read when making recommendations.

## Recommended Reading

The training framework draws from these books. We recommend them for any ultrarunner who wants to understand the science behind their training:

**[Intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu)** is the training platform that powers the data layer. It's free, but please consider supporting it — it's an incredible tool built by a small team.

## Working with a Coach

The best thing you can do for your running is work with a real coach. A good coach sees things data can't capture — your form, your confidence, the way you carry stress — and builds a relationship that adapts to who you are, not just what your numbers say.

This tool is designed to complement that relationship, not replace it. Between coaching sessions, it can handle the daily details: adjusting a workout when your schedule changes, reviewing an activity, or explaining why a training block is structured the way it is. Some coaches may find it useful as a tool in their own practice.
